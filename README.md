# **Generating-Datasets-of-Entangled-Mixed-States-by-Quantum-Machine-Learning**
## This is the numerical simulation code for [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06452)
## Our code can reproduce all data figures presented in the paper. Numerical simulations appearing in different chapters are organized in corresponding folders with identical names.
## Important Notes:
1,Code files not contained in these folders are widely referenced across other scripts. To ensure successful reproduction, you must copy them to the appropriate paths to prevent runtime errors.
2,The ["States"](States) folder contains generated mixed-state datasets. When running benchmarks, please ensure all outputs are saved in their designated paths.
