# **Generating-Datasets-of-Entangled-Mixed-States-by-Quantum-Machine-Learning**
## This is the numerical simulation code for [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06452)
## Our code can reproduce data figures presented in the paper. Numerical simulations appearing in different chapters are organized in corresponding folders with similar names.
## Important Notes:
$\bullet$ Code files not contained in these folders are widely referenced across other scripts. To ensure successful reproduction, you must copy them to the appropriate paths to prevent runtime errors.

$\bullet$ The ["States"](States) folder contains generated mixed-state datasets. When executing benchmarks, please ensure all quantum state data is stored in the designated working directory of the corresponding code.
